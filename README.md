üìÇ Project Structure
File	Description
index.html	The main HTML structure, including the input, button, and the YouTube <iframe>.
style.css	Styles for the page layout, card design, controls, and responsive adjustments.
script.js	Contains the core logic for extracting the video ID, handling button clicks, and updating the player's src.
Key JavaScript Logic
The extractYouTubeID(url) function in script.js is responsible for parsing the URL:
‚Ä¢	It checks for youtu.be links and extracts the ID from the pathname.
‚Ä¢	It checks for standard youtube.com links and extracts the ID from the v query parameter (v=...).
‚Ä¢	It also supports direct input of the 11-character video ID.
‚Ä¢	If a valid ID is found, it constructs the new embed URL (https://www.youtube.com/embed/...) and sets it as the src for the player <iframe>.
